hello! this is my first time posting anything to github ever so i'm not 
familiar with any standards as to how a readme should be organized.

to play my game, you just need to clone the file/repo onto your computer,
then either click the py file in the File Explorer or in cmd navigate to the 
folder and then enter: py (or python depending on your machine) numberGuesser.py

enjoy!
